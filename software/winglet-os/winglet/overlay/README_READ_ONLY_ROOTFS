The root filesystem is mounted as read only! This is
done to prevent filesystem corruption from abrupt
shut downs. To conserve space, the rootfs is imaged
as ext2 WHICH IS NOT JOURNALED and much more
susceptible to power loss events than the standard ext4.

MOST PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO REMOUNT THIS AS READ WRITE!
Instead, work out of the /var folder (your home folder
is in /var/root, which is writable). Most things can
be done in this folder.

Although the OS does not prevent you from remounting
the root partition as R/W, take care to avoid damaging
critical OS files, as this image cannot heal from a
damaged rootfs, unlike a corrupted user data partition.

Additionally, if any updates are released in the future,
they will only make an effort to preserve the user data
partition. Any changes to the rootfs WILL be lost.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

The magic command to make it r/w is:
    mount -o remount,rw /

and back to read only (DO THIS BEFORE KILLING POWER!)
    mount -o remount,ro /

Use with caution! (And happy hacking!)
